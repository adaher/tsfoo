TypeScript + RequireJS sample configuration

### 1. Modules are dynamically loaded by RequireJS

If you build the project in Visual Studio or run `grunt` without parameters, you'll have the compiled JS in the `compiled` folder. Open `default.htm` in the browser to see this configuration in action.

### 2. Modules are combined into one file and loaded by RequireJS

`grunt rjs`

### 3. [Almond](https://github.com/jrburke/almond)

`grunt almond`
